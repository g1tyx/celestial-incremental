			- Continued work on the buyable code rework, layers improved this patch are hex, grass, AD, and ID.<br>
			- As I said last patch, this also means the buy max buttons on those layers are subtab specific now.<br><br>

			- Fixed Oil buy max buttons not loading correctly.<br>
			- Fixed Dice rolling with one less side then intended.<br>

			- Reduced the base cost of Dice Buyable 'DP Multiplier' from 6,000 to 2,000.<br>
			- Locked Rocket Fuel OTF behind having your first infinity.<br>
			- Severely decreased Cante challenge upgrade costs.<br><br>
		???:<br>
			- Begun work on buyable code rework, current layers done are: Ranks, Factors, Prestige, Trees, Grasshoppers.<br>
			- Since of this, all buy max buttons on those layers are subtab specific and not controlled by the main variable.<br>
