	<h3>v1.2.1 - Softcaps and Inflation Squashing</h3><br>
		- CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRE GAME. READ WITH CAUTION.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Bugfixes:<br>
			- Fixed Oil buy max buttons not loading correctly.<br>
			- Fixed Dice rolling with one less side then intended.<br>
			- Fixed tooltip on the first XP Boost button.<br>
			- Fixed many visual bugs with Grass Upgrade 11.<br>
			- Hopefully fixed the challenge completion bug this time. Maybe.<br>
			- Fixed inflation bug caused by TAV debuff upgrade 1 working outside of the challenge.<br>
			- Added check to revert any inflation from a previously fixed TAV debuff inflation bug.<br>
			- Fixed method to spam rocket fuel XP button.<br>
			- Fixed Grass Factor unlock text showing even when having all grass factors unlocked.<br>
			- Thanks to buyable code rework, fixed multiple bugs related to grasshopper buyable cap.<br>
			- Fixed Prestige Points on reset text showing at 250,000 points instead of 100,000 points.<br>
			- Fixed Clock Evolution tooltip not showing.<br><br>
		Typos:<br>
			- Fixed OTF Mastery buyable 'Alternate Infinity Mastery Multiplier' having a misspelt effect.<br>
			- Fixed Tav Domain's Stop Conversions button being misspelt as 'Converions'.<br>
			- Fixed Pent Milestone 3 misspelling Currently as 'Currenty'.<br>
			- Fixed Pent Milestone 4 saying that mods are under trees, when they aren't.<br>
			- Fixed Clock Evolution's special feature having misspelt upgrade names.<br>
			- Fixed Drippy Ufo Evolution tooltip misspelling Moonstone as 'moontstone'.<br><br>
		QoL:<br>
			- Booster Dice can no longer roll the current boosted effect.<br>
			- Re-added shop alerts and the alert toggle, because options are nice.<br>

			- Severely decreased Cante challenge upgrade costs.<br><br>
		???:<br>
			- Begun work on buyable code rework, current layers done are: Ranks, Factors, Prestige, Trees, Grasshoppers.<br>
			- Since of this, all buy max buttons on those layers are subtab specific and not controlled by the main variable.<br>
